# TODO

- Handle lists.
  - Related lists.
  - Items in a list may not be fully homogeneous.
- Type hinting. Example: 'cmc' looks like a float but is actually a Decimal.
- Proper ID mapping (instead of blindly assuming there isn't one).
- Output to SQLalchemy instead of stringy-SQL.
- Detect enums when there's a small number of noted values.
